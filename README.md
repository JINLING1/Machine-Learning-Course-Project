# Machine Learning Course Project

## I. Project Overview

This project focuses on an **image binary classification** task. It aims to classify facial emotions into two categories: **"Happy"** and **"Sad"**, using machine learning algorithms, particularly **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.  
ðŸŽ¯ **Target accuracy**: > **79%**

## II. Technical Solutions

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**  
  The core architecture that automatically learns spatial features in images, such as:
  - Facial expression contours  
  - Curvature of the mouth corners  
  - Shape of eyebrows  
  CNNs are highly suitable for image recognition tasks.

- **Activation Function: ReLU**  
  - Prevents vanishing gradient problems  
  - Enhances non-linear representation capabilities  
  - Improves convergence speed

- **Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy**  
  - Tailored for binary classification tasks  
  - Measures the divergence between predicted values and true labels

- **Optimizer: Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)**  
  - Combines momentum and adaptive learning rate  
  - Ensures faster convergence and robust optimization during training
